Highest priority to lowest priority:

Encode T matrix twist

Encode Vec_{Z_N} data

Calculate some verifiable modular data 

Do everything wrt two complexes
   Write simple tests

Actually calculate the $R$ matrix wrt to basis of simple
objects.  

Optimization: Keep objects/morphisms as tensor products.
Calculate compositions factorwise if possible.

Use sums instead of direct sum at appropriate times

Dehackify ev method.

Write unit tests for important methods.

Refactor so that constructors are lower case methods
      Uppercase should be destructors only

Calculate an actual R-matrix of a simple TY category.

Style refactoring
    - comment top-level (exported) functions
    - consistent use of State Stringnet
    
Make all functions total
      - Get rid of toIV type casts

Factor TwoComplex out of Stringnet

unit tests

Ideas: Make a LocalMoves type.
       Add left duals
       Refactor using Simplex n

Double-check InteriorVertex vs. Vertex typing

Get rid of unpacking matrix (only used for profiling).
